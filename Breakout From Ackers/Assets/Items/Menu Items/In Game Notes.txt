Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it (say it)
Inside, we both know what's been going on (going on)
We know the game and we're gonna play it

Hey. Sorry to leave you all alone like this. But if you're reading this, that means you're at least feeling well enough again to walk about.

I'm not really sure what happened but I think one of the privates mixed up some of their pills with with ones the old owner left in the house. A couple of hours later and all things went to hell. He went off and starting attacking the other patients. Acted like he lost his mind. 

It's been a few hours now and I don't hear much out there besides a couple of groans every once in a while. I'm gonna go out and see if I can find anybody still alright out there. If I'm not back before you read this, I've left a gun for you on the table to your left. The key to the door is back behind you.

Hopefully, I'll be back before you even can get up and see this. If not, get to the foyer and use the large door to get out of here.

I left this unfinished puzzle to remind myself of the combination for
the chest in the upstairs servants' quarters.

5 3 4 | 6 7 8 | 9 1 2
6 7 2 | 1 9 5 | 3 4 8
   9 8 | 3 4 2 | 5 6  
--------------------------
8 5 9 | 7 6 1 | 4 2 3
4 2 6 | 8    3 | 7 9 1
7 1 3 | 9 2 4 | 8 5 6
--------------------------
9 6 1 | 5 3 7 | 2 8 4
2 8 7 | 4 1    | 6 3 5
3 4 5 | 2 8 6 | 1 7 9

I've moved the old chest out from the attic and into the game room. Some things I just don't think ought to be left lying around. I'd rather have them locked up safe.

If Acker has an issue with it, let me know. 

It's an old chest he got years ago, back in the "good" days. It was from when he helped structure all of the ancillary information for the derby and their game day schedules and programming. AI for Game Programming, I think they called it. The code should be something with that, too.

I think it'll be fine for us to use.

My secrets are mine and mine alone. 

No one was there to help me create blue mass and they are all gone again now while it wanes.

The only ones there for me now are the three guardians keeping my secret safe.

Whatever I come up with, I'll make sure the credit only goes to me. My stone guardians will help guarantee that.
